# Free Washington DC Scenery Pack - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

Version 0.1.0

If you have flown low over Washington DC in the vanilla version of MSFS 2020, you may have noticed that the National Mall and nearby landmarks are poorly rendered (if at all). The Washington Monument is especially egregious, having been replaced with a tall, skinny skyscraper. The Capitol Building is a wide, flat office building.

Well no more! The goal of this scenery pack is to fill in some of the most critical landmarks around Washington

All of the models in this pack are free. They were either hand-crafted or downloaded license-free from a 3D model exchange site. This scenery pack does not and will not use 3D data or textures from Google Maps.
